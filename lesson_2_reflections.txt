What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing adds the necessary git files and tracks what files are already
in the directory.  Without the init git would have no where to track the 
commits and history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is like a temporary place to get all the changes together
before we commit.  The working directory is what is actually there, while
the repository is about what is being tracked.  The staging area allows
you to work with many files in the current state and decide what needs to
be added into the repository for everyone, versus things you only need on
a single machine.
