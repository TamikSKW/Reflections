When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The remote repository keeps a backup of your work so that if you were to lose your local work
for some reason you will be able to get it back.  Its partially so you can share your work
easier and part for redundancy.  It is a horrifying idea losing all the work and hours you
have put into a project because of a stupid mistake.
